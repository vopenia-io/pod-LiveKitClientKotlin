# Changelog

## [2.6.0] - 2025-06-07

### Added

- Initial version based upon minimalist implementation to mimic LiveKitClient
- Wrap classes which are clashing from the expected delegate behaviour

### Notice

_When_ the issues with the delegates in Kotlin will be found, this pod will become obsolete.

This pod will try to follow its version based on the LiveKitClient's actual version
